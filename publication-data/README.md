# identify sample sets from available data

```bash
Rscript --slave generateSamples.R
```

Samples of length 5 were generated by splitting length 10 samples.
Not all samples of length 5, 10 and 15 are non-overlapping (selected via 
different script by Alexander Mattheis)

# generate chronologies for each sample set (excluding the samples)

```bash
Rscript --slave generateChronoRingWidth.R
Rscript --slave generateChronoMaxDens.R
```

for consensus-based ranking, we first have to compute MICA alignments per year
(and sample set to exclude the samples). the resulting consensus profiles have 
to be interpolated to 100 data points per year.
 
```
TODO Rscript --slave generateChronoMICA.R
Rscript --slave generateChronoConsensus.R
```


# compute cross-dating performance

```bash
Rscript --slave rankRingWidth.R
Rscript --slave rankMaxDens.R
Rscript --slave rankProfileSet.R
Rscript --slave rankTwoStep.R
```
